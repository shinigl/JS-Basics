Javascript is a lightweight and interpreted language . 

lightweight -> low CPU usage 
interpreted -> reads code line by line 

Q 1: What type of language is JS?
Ans : Object based 
Not fully OOPS , because of primitive data types.

***FEATURES***

1. Control Statements 
2. Platform independent (can run on any OS) ***
3. Asynchrounous processing 
4. Event handling 

Q 2: How JS can be run outside the browser?

Ans : Node.js 

It is a JS runtime environment that allows developers to run JS code outside the web browser.
Node is built on V8 engine (which is also used by Google Chrome).

***Variables***

It is a container which stores a value .

Ways to declare a variable:
1. var 
2. let
3. const

Ex: var x = 7 ;
    x -> identifer


***Q:3 (Interview) : Difference b/w var , let and const 

1. Inititalization 

var can be declared *without* Inititalization
let can be declared *without* Inititalization
const cannot be declared *without* Inititalization

2. Declaration
var can be updated and re-declared
let  can  be updated but cannot be re-declared
const  cannot be updated but cannot be re-declared

3.Scope : Scope is the accessibility of variables, functions & objects in some particular part of code 
during run-time .

var is global scoped 
let is block scoped
const is block scoped

Interview<--------- TEMPORAL DEAD ZONE -------->
The variable is said to be in TDZ until the time period when a variable exists in a scope 
but cant be accessed .


<------TYPE COERCION----->

The process of converting value from one type to another .

There are two types :

1. Explicit : When you change the type manually .


2. Implicit : When the types are converted automatically when applied operators .

 Q.  let a = null ;
      console.log(typeof(a));  // o/p : object

 Q. Why type of null is object ?
// **** It is a bug in JS and null signifies an empty reference to an object ***



<----- null v/s undefined ---->

undefined : When the variable has not been assigned to any value or not even declared .

null : It is a value which refers to a empty value .
